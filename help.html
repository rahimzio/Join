                <p>Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services
                    that
                    deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously.
                    Work
                    is represented on Kanban boards, allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams and
                    handle
                    even the most complex projects in a single environment.</p>
                <p>To visualize your process with a Kanban system, you will need a board with cards and columns. Each
                    column
                    on the board represents a step in your workflow. Each Kanban card represents a work item. The Kanban
                    board itself represents the actual state of your workflow with all its risks and specifications.</p>
                <p>The first and most important thing for you is understanding what it takes to get an item from a
                    request
                    to a deliverable product. Recognizing how work flows through your system will set you on the path to
                    continuous improvement by making well-observed and necessary changes.</p>
                <p>When you start working on item X, you pull it from the “To Do” column, and when it is completed, you
                    move
                    it to “Done”. This way, you can easily track progress and spot bottlenecks. Naturally, your Kanban
                    board
                    might have a different outlook as it depends on your specific needs and processes.</p>

                <h4 class="txt-h4">How to use it:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The first step is to create a contact. This contact is needed to assign the task to a person
                            later on. The first name, last name and email address are mandatory information and have to
                            be entered. The phone number is optional.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The next step is to create a task. This can be done via the board, the Add Task tab or
                            directly in the contact list. With the task you can define a task with a due date, assign
                            the responsible persons and add a description. This task is then visible on the board and
                            can be managed there.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The board can be used to manage, edit and delete created tasks. These can be moved to the
                            corresponding columns 'To do', 'In progress', 'Awaiting feedback' and 'Done' via drag and
                            drop to represent the current status.</p>
                    </li>
